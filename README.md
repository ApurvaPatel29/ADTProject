# EDA-of-Aquaculture-and-Fisheries-alongwith-yield-prediction-of-several-fish-species.

This project I have done during my Master's program under the subject of Advanced Database Topic (ADT).

This project used Python and its libraries like Seaborn, pandas, NumPy, etc. for the exploratory data analysis of aquaculture and fisheries carried out in several countries.
Also, I have used linear regression for the yield prediction of several fish species based on their body and weight dimensions.

The result of this project was that the production of fish from aquaculture overtook the fisheries. Also the yield prediction suggests the aquafarmers what measures should be take based on the predicted numbers so 
that they can increase their product.
