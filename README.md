# EDA-of-Aquaculture-and-Fisheries-alongwith-yield-prediction-of-several-fish-species.

This project was done during my Master's program under the subject of Advanced Database Topic (ADT).
This project used Python and its libraries like Seaborn, Pandas, NumPy, etc. for the exploratory data analysis and data visualization of aquaculture and fisheries carried out in several countries. Also, I have used linear regression for the yield prediction of several fish species based on their body and weight dimensions.
The result of this project was that the production of fish from aquaculture overtook the fisheries. Also, the yield prediction suggests to the aqua farmers what measures should be take based on the predicted numbers so that they can increase their product.
